# social-network-api

## Description 
Welcome to my Social Network API backend application. In this project, I've used Express.js for routing and MongoDB as the database, along with the Mongoose ODM. MongoDB's speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data made it the ideal choice for this application.

For this project, I wanted to create an API where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. I also ensured that users could delete thoughts and update their thoughts while having the option to delete their personal user and their associated thoughts.

My goal in creating this project was to gain hands-on experience with building APIs for social networking applications. Building the API first is crucial since it lays the foundation for the entire application.

## User Story

To use this application, you must git clone this repository to your local computer and then navigate to the repository through the terminal. 

Once, you've done that, install the npm packages by typing the following command into your terminal:
```md
npm i
```

Now, to start the server, type in:

After starting the server, you can test the API routes using a tool like Insomnia. The API routes can be found in the routes folder of the application.
